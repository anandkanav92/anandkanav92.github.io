Due to increase in use of vehicles, one major problem that the modernized society is facing is traffic congestion. Specifically in metro cities, this problem is high, because development of the city does not provide room for construction of new roads. Efficient use of the available facilities will be a positive approach in this situation. Any network is best represented using a weighted graph. In this paper we propose a method of using the available roads more efficient by using sensors in the signal junctions, using weighted graphs.
