## Hello.
I'm Kanav Anand and I am currently living in Delft, Netherlands working at a startup [ADI](https://applieddroneinnovations.nl/) as a Data Scientist.

I previously worked at [InMobi](https://www.inmobi.com/) in Bangalore building data pipeline used to collect user data for showing relevant ads and at [Knolskape](https://www.knolskape.com/) developing web simulations to train and test future leaders and managers.

In 2019, I graduated from the Delft University of Technology in Netherlands with a master degree in Data Science. I did my master thesis on the topic - 
Given a fixed deep learning model architecture, how much does the final performance depends on the person who optimizes the deep network? `(spoiler: a lot!)â€‹` more details [here](http://bit.ly/2CrjC9T)

Developing applications around big data has been a big passion of mine. I experiment alot with new machine learning models applying them in different domains. 

I recently won [Dutch mobility hackathon](https://www.dutchmobilityhackathon.nl/)! (blog upcoming)

Take a look at my blog, feel free to contact me via email.
